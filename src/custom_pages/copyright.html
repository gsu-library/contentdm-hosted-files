  <h3>Copyright and the Collections</h3>

  <p>
    Whenever possible, we provide information that we have about copyright
    owners and related matters in the records that accompany collections and
    items. However, the information we have may not be complete. Rights
    information for each item is included in standard
    <a href="http://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=en"
      >RightsStatements.org language</a
    >. The majority of content in our collections is under copyright. We
    generally do not own the rights to materials in our collections and so
    cannot grant or deny permission to use them. By downloading, printing, or
    otherwise using text and images from this website, you agree that you are
    solely responsible for determining the copyright status of any materials you
    may wish to use, and that you will satisfy any copyright or use restrictions
    when publishing or distributing materials from our collections. In all
    cases, you must include the citation provided in the record, and, when
    applicable, you must cite all copyright information and comply with all
    other terms or restrictions that may be applicable to that material. We
    request that anyone linking to our websites present the link in a manner

  <h3>Privacy and Publicity Rights</h3>

  <p>
    The rights of privacy and publicity are separate and distinct issues from
    copyright. While copyright laws protect the copyright owner's property
    rights in the work, privacy and publicity rights protect the interests of
    the individuals who are the subject of the work. The right of publicity is a
    personâ€™s right to control, and profit from, the use of his or her name,
    image and likeness. Copyright is protected by federal law under the United
    States Copyright Act, whereas privacy and publicity rights are primarily
    governed by state law. What is allowed in one state may not be allowed in
    another.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you use materials from our websites, then you are responsible for
    determining whether there are privacy and publicity rights considerations.
    When weighing privacy and publicity rights, consider the type of materials
    and their intended use.
  </p>

  <p>

    Library collections and believe that our websites have not properly
    attributed your work or have used it without permission, please
