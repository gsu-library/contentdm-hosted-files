  <h1>Georgia State University Statement on Potentially Offensive Content</h1>

  <p>
    Georgia State University (GSU) shares materials from the Library and Special
    Collections and Archives online. Our websites include historical and primary
    sources from many cultures and time periods. Some content (or its
    descriptions) may be emotionally harmful, offensive and difficult to view.
    These materials may be graphic or reflect biases. In some cases, they may
    conflict with strongly held cultural values, beliefs or restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We provide access to these materials to preserve the historical record, but
    we do not endorse the attitudes, prejudices, or behaviors found within them.
  </p>

  <h2>Creation of the Statement</h2>
  <p>
    GSU is a content provider to the Digital Library of Georgia (DLG) which is a
    member service hub of the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). GSU
    modeled its statement on DLG’s and DPLA’s. DPLA staff and its metadata
    working group drafted the DPLA statement. Outside experts and the network
    reviewed it before approval.
  </p>
  <p>
    DLG staff simplified the statement’s language to improve its readability
    based on Georgia Department of Education eighth grade reading levels. Staff
    at GALILEO, Georgia Public Library Service, NGE, UGA Libraries, and DLG
    partners reviewed the draft statement.
  </p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h4>Where does this content come from?</h4>

  <p>
    GSU digitizes and shares historical content online for free from the general
    Library collections, special collections and university archives. A few
    collections come from partner institutions and collections, both within the
    University and from outside partners.
  </p>

  <h4>
    What offensive or difficult content may be found in Digital Collections?
  </h4>
  <p>Some items may:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Reflect white supremacist and imperialist views, including racist, sexist,
      and xenophobic opinions and attitudes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Be biased against or exclude diverse views on sexuality, gender, ableism,
      religion, and more.
    </li>
    <li>
      Include graphic content such as violent death, medical procedures, crime,
      wars, natural disasters and more.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate bias and exclusion in library/museum collecting and
      digitization.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Why does GSU make this content available?</h4>

  <p>
    GSU Library collects, preserves, and presents these materials as part of the
    historic record and for research purposes. Together, they work to balance
    the preservation of history with its sensitive display.
  </p>

  <h4>
    How is this material described? Why are some of the terms used offensive?
  </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Librarians and archivists choose what language to use when describing
      materials. Some descriptions were written in the past and use language
      that was accepted at the time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Librarians and archivists often re-use language provided by creators or
      former owners of the material. This can provide important context and can
      also reflect biases and prejudices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Librarians and archivists often use standardized sets of terms to describe
      materials. Some of these terms are outdated, offensive, or insensitive.
    </li>
    <li>
      Communities with less privilege historically have had less control over
      how they are portrayed and described.
    </li>
    <li>
      Librarians and archivists sometimes make mistakes or use poor judgment.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    GSU is working towards a plan to assess and update offensive or emotionally
    harmful descriptions, add disclaimers to sensitive or graphic material, and
    create redacted cover images for graphic items.
  </p>

  <h4>How is GSU addressing legacy descriptions?</h4>

  <p>
    We are currently creating a plan to address our legacy descriptions, provide
    warnings for our offensive and emotionally harmful content and diversify our
    collections. This plan may include activities such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Including warnings on collections with this type of content.</li>
    <li>
      Prioritizing digitization of content from less privileged communities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Working directly with misrepresented communities when describing them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Revising and enhancing descriptions with more respectful,
      community-selected terms.
    </li>
    <li>Creating new, more inclusive standardized terms.</li>
    <li>
      Listening to users, researching to find solutions, and sharing our
      results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Evaluating current policies for practices that prioritize one culture
      and/or group over another.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>As our work progresses, we will update this statement.</p>

  <h4>What happens if I report offensive content?</h4>

  <p>
    We encourage our users to
    <a href="https://dlg.usg.edu/about/harmful-content-form"
      >offensive content</a
    >. GSU staff will determine whether to change or remove the content. We
    weigh the potential harm, accurate preservation of the historical record,
    professional practices, and limited resources. GSU will use all reports to
    better understand the issue, further refine our plan, and share.
